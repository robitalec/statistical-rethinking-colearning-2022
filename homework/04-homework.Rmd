## Question 1

Marriage is a collider between age and happiness. If we include marriage 
as a predictor, it will generate an association between age and happiness.

```{r h04_q01_dag}
dag <- dagify(
  Marriage ~ Happiness + Age,
  exposure = 'Age',
  outcome = 'Happiness'
)
dag_plot(dag, 'graphics/homework/dot_h04_q01')
```

```{r h04_q01_loo}
tar_read(loo_m609)
tar_read(loo_m610)
tar_read(compare_h04_q01)
```
