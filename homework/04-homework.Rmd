## Question 1

> Revisit the marriage, age, and happiness collider bias example from Chapter
6. Run models m6.9 and m6.10 again (pages 178–179). Compare these two models
using both PSIS and WAIC. Which model is expected to make better predictions,
according to these criteria? On the basis of the causal model, how should you
interpret the parameter estimates from the model preferred by PSIS and WAIC?

Marriage is a collider between age and happiness. If we include marriage 
as a predictor, it will generate an association between age and happiness.

```{r h04_q01_dag}
dag <- dagify(
  Marriage ~ Happiness + Age,
  exposure = 'Age',
  outcome = 'Happiness'
)
dag_plot(dag, 'graphics/homework/dot_h04_q01')
```

```{r h04_q01_loo}
message('Model 1: Happiness ~ intercept[marriage index] + age')
tar_read(loo_m609)

message('Model 2: Happiness ~ intercept + age')
tar_read(loo_m610)

message('Compared')
tar_read(compare_h04_q01)
```

The PSIS LOO results indicating that the model that includes marriage
has more predictive power, it does not indicate that the causal structure
or potential confounds are correctly accounted for in the model. 
Marriage status is a collider, creating a statistical association between
age and happiness, and when removed from the model, there is no longer an
association between these variables. 

```{r h04_q01_params}
message('Model 1: Happiness ~ intercept[marriage index] + age')
plot(precis(data.table(tar_read(h04_q01_m609_draws_h04_q01_m609))[, .(sigma, beta_age, `alpha[1]`, `alpha[2]`)], depth = 2))

message('Model 2: Happiness ~ intercept + age')
plot(precis(data.table(tar_read(h04_q01_m610_draws_h04_q01_m610))[, .(sigma, beta_age, alpha)]))
```

## Question 2

> Reconsider the urban fox analysis from last week’s homework. On the basis of
PSIS and WAIC scores, which combination of variables best predicts body weight
(W, weight)? How would you interpret the estimates from the best scoring model?

![](../graphics/homework/dot_h03_q02.png)


```{r h04_q02_loo}
print(loo_compare(list(
  a = tar_read(loo_h04_q02_a), 
  f = tar_read(loo_h04_q02_f),
  fg  = tar_read(loo_h04_q02_fg),
  ga = tar_read(loo_h04_q02_ga),
  fga = tar_read(loo_h04_q02_fga)
)), simplify = FALSE)
```

The fitted models are compared using PSIS LOO and the comparison 
returns the difference in ELPD (theoretical expected log pointwise
predictive density) from the model with the highest ELPD. 

See more details in `help('loo-glossary')`. 

Based on this, the model that includes all three predictors is slightly 
better than the models with food and group size, and with area and 
group size. This model has the highest predictive power, and we will use the 
DAG to evaluate what the parameters returned by this model represent. 


The parameter for group size represents the direct effect of group size on
weight. The parameter for food represents the direct causal effect of 
food but since area is included in the model and, according to the DAG, area
causes food availability, then it is potentially impacted by area. The indirect causal effect of food is not possible to estimate since group size 
is included in the model. The parameter for area is confounded by the
inclusion of food since it is a mediator between area and weight. 

```{r h04_q02_params}
plot(precis(data.table(tar_read(h04_q02_draws_h04_q02_fga))[, .(sigma, alpha, beta_food, beta_groupsize, beta_area)]))
```


# Question 3

> Adjusted Q3 for our colearning group: 
> - Take a question/model from your own work, and draw the DAG. Try to think about unobserved variables in addition to things you did measure.
> - List the variables in your DAG and define them. What are the units? What is a reasonable range of values (using information from a different source than your own data)?
> - Define or justify the edges in your DAG. Just a sentence or two, but enough to clarify why you/literature/science/logic think this relationship exists.


```{r h04_q03_dag}
dag <- dagify(
  Drought_sensitivity ~ HAND + Dist_major_lake + Long_term_normals + Shape_index + Land_cover + Prop_water + Elevation + Aspect,
  HAND ~ Dist_major_lake,
  # exposure = ,
  outcome = 'Drought_sensitivity'
)
dag_plot(dag, 'graphics/homework/dot_h04_q03')
